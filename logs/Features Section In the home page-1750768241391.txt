I've successfully updated the Features Section with 6 compelling features that highlight Squint's main USPs:\n\n1. **AI knowledge transformation** - Emphasizes their core ability to convert existing tribal knowledge into structured procedures\n2. **Immersive spatial guidance** - Showcases their AR capabilities for frontline operators\n3. **Real-time AI assistance** - Highlights their on-the-job help and Q&A features\n4. **Performance analytics** - Emphasizes their insights and compliance tracking capabilities\n5. **Instant procedure creation** - Shows the ease and speed of their mapping technology\n6. **Enterprise-grade security** - Addresses their SOC 2 compliance and security features\n\nEach feature has a concise title (3-4 words) and a short description (under 20 words) that clearly communicates the value proposition. The features are ordered to flow from knowledge creation, to guidance delivery, to support and analytics, ending with security - which follows a logical user journey.\n\nI've also removed the \"generating\" prop as requested and updated the subtitle to be more specific to Squint's value proposition: \"Transform knowledge into action.\""}],"id":"msg-y89CEVBhYBwc7SRGZi0Tug1n"}]},"isContinued":false}],"sources":[]}
