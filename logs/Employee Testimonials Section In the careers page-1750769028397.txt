We’re building AI-based tools that make industrial jobs safer and faster, and nothing we do sits in a hypothetical. Last month alone, I helped ship a new feature that’s already in use on manufacturing lines across three countries. The technical bar here is high, but the feedback loop with customers is even faster—which is incredibly motivating.”\n\n— Ayman Florentino, senior software engineer, engineering\n\n—\n\n“What drew me in was a remote culture that actually feels human. Squint practices deep collaboration without constant meetings—instead, it's clear expectations, trust, and meaningful work. I’ve grown more here in a year than I did in three elsewhere. Being able to sketch, test, and scale a design directly with real operator workflows is something very few product teams get to do.”\n\n— Saige Chang, product design lead, product and design\n\n—\n\n“In my first eight weeks, I got to lead a proof-of-concept rollout for a global industrial customer—working directly with their ops, learning team, and floor technicians. That level of ownership is rare, and it’s one of the reasons Squint moves faster than most startups I’ve seen. Add in a supportive team, badgeless logins, fast demos, and well-built tools… it all just clicks.”\n\n— Julien Dorsey, customer success manager, sales and customer success\n\n—\n\nWe’re building tools to make complex work simpler—for the people who keep the world running.

We’re building AI-based tools that make industrial jobs safer and faster, and nothing we do sits in a hypothetical. Last month alone, I helped ship a new feature that’s already in use on manufacturing lines across three countries. The technical bar here is high, but the feedback loop with customers is even faster—which is incredibly motivating.”\n\n— Ayman Florentino, senior software engineer, engineering\n\n—\n\n“What drew me in was a remote culture that actually feels human. Squint practices deep collaboration without constant meetings—instead, it's clear expectations, trust, and meaningful work. I’ve grown more here in a year than I did in three elsewhere. Being able to sketch, test, and scale a design directly with real operator workflows is something very few product teams get to do.”\n\n— Saige Chang, product design lead, product and design\n\n—\n\n“In my first eight weeks, I got to lead a proof-of-concept rollout for a global industrial customer—working directly with their ops, learning team, and floor technicians. That level of ownership is rare, and it’s one of the reasons Squint moves faster than most startups I’ve seen. Add in a supportive team, badgeless logins, fast demos, and well-built tools… it all just clicks.”\n\n— Julien Dorsey, customer success manager, sales and customer success\n\n—\n\nWe’re building tools to make complex work simpler—for the people who keep the world running.

We’re building AI-based tools that make industrial jobs safer and faster, and nothing we do sits in a hypothetical. Last month alone, I helped ship a new feature that’s already in use on manufacturing lines across three countries. The technical bar here is high, but the feedback loop with customers is even faster—which is incredibly motivating.”\n\n— Ayman Florentino, senior software engineer, engineering\n\n—\n\n“What drew me in was a remote culture that actually feels human. Squint practices deep collaboration without constant meetings—instead, it's clear expectations, trust, and meaningful work. I’ve grown more here in a year than I did in three elsewhere. Being able to sketch, test, and scale a design directly with real operator workflows is something very few product teams get to do.”\n\n— Saige Chang, product design lead, product and design\n\n—\n\n“In my first eight weeks, I got to lead a proof-of-concept rollout for a global industrial customer—working directly with their ops, learning team, and floor technicians. That level of ownership is rare, and it’s one of the reasons Squint moves faster than most startups I’ve seen. Add in a supportive team, badgeless logins, fast demos, and well-built tools… it all just clicks.”\n\n— Julien Dorsey, customer success manager, sales and customer success\n\n—\n\nWe’re building tools to make complex work simpler—for the people who keep the world running.
